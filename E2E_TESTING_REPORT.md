## Data Flow Analysis

### Mock Data Generation
```typescript
// Reputation scores are deterministic based on wallet address
function generateMockScore(address: string): number {
  const hash = hashAddress(address);
  return 600000 + (hash % 400000); // Range: 600,000 - 1,000,000
}

// Trust network data is generated with realistic topology
const mockNetworkData = {
  nodes: 12547, // Total users
  edges: 28934, // Total relationships
  avgScore: 0.723, // Network average
  zkProofs: 3847 // Total ZK proofs
};
```

### Real Data Integration Points
```typescript
// Production mode would replace mock functions with API calls
const productionDataFlow = {
  reputationScores: "API call to backend with EBSL calculation",
  trustNetwork: "GraphQL queries for network topology",
  zkProofs: "EZKL backend integration for proof generation",
  blockchain: "Smart contract interactions for claims"
};
```
