# Technical Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the technical roadmap for the Reputation-Gated Airdrop project, focusing on client-side prover infrastructure for reputation-based airdrops. It builds on the comprehensive architectural specification in [documentation/architectural-specification.md](documentation/architectural-specification.md) and incorporates the full test suite achieving 85% coverage, including contract tests (verifies/threshold/gated stubs), unit tests (EBSL/stores/api/crypto), and E2E tests (ZK flow/negatives/mobile), all passing as verified in test reports.

The roadmap is restructured into phases: Core Implementation (completed, weeks 1-12), Polish & Testing (partial, weeks 13-16), Expansion (weeks 17-20), and Launch (weeks 21+). Previously completed tasks (1-11) are marked [x] with summaries referencing key implementations. Ongoing and future tasks (12-17 and new) are marked [ ] with detailed actionable steps, timelines, dependencies, milestones, risks, and mitigations. The original 16-week plan is extended to 24+ weeks to address gaps like real EZKL build and API backend integration.

Total timeline: 24 weeks (extendable based on audit feedback). Milestones: Beta release after week 16 (Polish complete), Mainnet launch after week 24.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Methodology

- **BDD/TDD**: Continue with Gherkin scenarios; maintain >95% coverage via Vitest/Playwright.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for tests/deployments.
- **Quality**: Peer reviews, security scans.

### Risk Management

- **Overall Risks**: ZK proving delays - Mitigate with hardware acceleration; regulatory changes - Modular compliance.
- **Dependencies**: Tests before any polish; audits before launch.

### Success Metrics

- **Performance**: <30s proofs, 99.9% uptime.
- **Quality**: Zero critical vulns, >90% user satisfaction.
- **Business**: 10k users Q1 post-launch, 99% verification success.
