# Shadowgraph Reputation-Gated Airdrop — Vision Delivery Blueprint

Purpose
- Translate the vision—reputation-scaled airdrops using DPKI, ZKML, and web-of-trust—into a concrete, testable delivery plan across protocol, proofs, clients, services, and ops.
- No fluff. Decision points are explicit, risks are owned, and acceptance gates are unambiguous.

Status
- Repo: SvelteKit dApp, contracts (ReputationAirdropScaled, ReputationAirdropZKScaled, ZKMLOnChainVerifier, MultiSig), testing harnesses, and extensive docs exist.
- Goal: Hardening + end-to-end proof-backed campaigns on testnet, then mainnet, with credible security, performance, and ops posture.

---

## 1) Vision and Success Criteria

The why
- Airdrops shouldn’t be dumb distribution. They should incentivize verifiable, sybil-resistant contribution via a composable reputation graph.
- Users prove reputation-derived eligibility without doxxing private data (ZKML + DPKI).
- Projects can run campaigns that are capital efficient, fair, and programmable.

Success criteria (hard acceptance)
- End-to-end flows live on testnet and mainnet:
  - ECDSA-claim path (signed allowance/payout from backend).
  - ZK-claim path (proof verifies on-chain; payout computed by contract with bounded curve).
- Deterministic scoring in mock mode and reproducible scoring in prod mode with strict versioning.
- Campaign operator UX (create, configure, fund, pause/unpause, close, export report).
- Gas and latency budgets met:
  - Claim verify + payout under N gas target (see Benchmarks).
  - ZK proof generation p50 <= 10s on a mid-tier box; queue supports burst > 1000 proofs/day.
- Security posture:
  - Property tests, fuzzing, Slither/Foundry checks, and one external audit passed.
  - Multisig-controlled upgrades, pausing, signer rotation, verifier key rotation.
- Observability:
  - Metrics + logs for proofs, claims, failures, and payout totals; dashboarded.
- Legal/privacy posture: zero PII ingested; explicit data-minimization; GDPR-safe.

North-star outcome
- Projects trust Shadowgraph to gate incentives via composable reputation and verifiable claims—without centralizing identity or leaking data.

---

## 2) System Overview (components and boundaries)

Components (current + target)
- Client: SvelteKit dApp (Vite, Tailwind, Viem, Web3-Onboard), mock and prod modes.
- Contracts: ReputationAirdropScaled, ReputationAirdropZKScaled, ZKMLOnChainVerifier, MultiSig, token.
- ZKML pipeline: Model quantization and circuit via ezkl; proof generation worker; verification key management; public input schema stability.
- DPKI / Shadowgraph identity: DID method(s), credential schema, revocation, address binding, web-of-trust edges (e.g., Semaphore or compatible).
- Backend services:
  - Signer/attestation service (ECDSA claims, EIP-712).
  - Reputation engine (data ingest -> features -> score -> attest).
  - Queue/worker for proof generation, caching, rate limiting.
  - Merkle tree builder (optional path) for snapshot campaigns.
- Infra/DevOps: CI/CD, RPC providers, secrets, storage of proving artifacts, telemetry.

Core invariants
- Determinism: Same inputs → same score/version → identical proof/allowance outcome.
- Auditability: Every issued allowance/proof maps to immutable records (event logs, attestations, signatures).
- Revocability: Keys, verifiers, signers are rotatable; campaigns pausable.

---

## 3) Workstreams and Deliverables

### A) Smart Contracts (Protocol)

Targets
- Finalize/verify:
  - ReputationAirdropScaled.sol: payout curve, claim window, nonce/replay protection, funded by ERC20.
  - ReputationAirdropZKScaled.sol: same semantics, but enforce score bounds via ZK verifier call.
  - ZKMLOnChainVerifier.sol: stable ABI; VK management/rotation; gas-lean verification.
  - MultiSig.sol: admin controls (pause, config changes, signer rotation), timelock optional.
- Additions/Hardening:
  - Access control via roles (Ownable2Step, AccessControl).
  - Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, EIP-712 domain separation (chain id, version).
  - Emissions: claim events include campaignId, address, payout, scoreBucket.
  - Optional: Merkle-snapshot claim path for predictable costs at scale.

Acceptance checks
- Unit tests: payout monotonicity, boundary conditions, window enforcement, funding underflow, double-claim prevention.
- Foundry/Hardhat gas benchmarks on target networks (Sepolia/Base/OP).
- Fuzzing: randomized scores and claim sequences; invariants hold.

Notes
- Align storage layout and upgrade path if proxies used. If not upgradable, deploy-by-campaign.

### B) ZKML Proof Pipeline

Targets
- Circuit design (ezkl) for score predicate:
  - Public inputs: user address commitment, score bounds (floor, cap), model commit/version, campaignId.
  - Proof statement: “Given features F and model M (committed), user’s score s ∈ [floor, cap] and payout bound P satisfies curve.”
- Model pipeline:
  - Feature spec and determinism; versioned model artifact; hash and commit in verifier.
  - Quantization + calibration to meet circuit constraints; accuracy-impact quantified.
- Prover:
  - Worker service to build proofs; cache by (address, campaignId, modelVersion).
  - GPU optional; fallback CPU; timeouts; concurrency controls; queue + retry.
- Verifier:
  - On-chain contract with VK registry (per modelVersion/campaign).
  - Off-chain verifier for pre-checks (saves users gas).

Acceptance checks
- Prove/verify across sample dataset; correctness vs. non-ZK baseline within epsilon.
- p50/p95 proving time measured; memory profile captured.
- ABI stability tests: changing modelVersion requires explicit key rotation on-chain.

Trade-offs
- Full “payout in circuit” vs. “score-range proof + on-chain curve”:
  - Choose: score-range proof + on-chain curve for simpler VK lifecycle and lower proof complexity.

### C) DPKI + Web-of-Trust (Shadowgraph Identity)

Targets
- DID + credential format for reputation attestations (schema, issuer keys, revocation).
- Address binding scheme: DID <-> wallet address (EIP-4361 SIWE attestation; or signature-anchored mapping).
- Web-of-trust:
  - Minimal viable: proof-of-membership (Semaphore group) + bounded depth trust edges.
  - Optional expansion: attestations weighted by issuer reputation.

Acceptance checks
- Issuance + revocation flows demoed; DID docs discoverable; verification CLI/tests.
- Graph queries deterministic; “sybil-resistance factor” measurable in scoring.

Notes
- Keep PII out. Attest only public facts or hashed statements with controlled reveal.

### D) Reputation Engine

Targets
- Deterministic scoring:
  - Feature sources: on-chain activity, attestations, social proofs (hashed/attested), contribution signals.
  - Feature registry with versioning; scoring function versioned.
  - Output: integer score s, plus diagnostic trace; persisted with modelVersion and inputs hash.
- Anti-gaming:
  - Rate limiting per address/device, consistency checks (entropy filters).
  - Temporal decay or streak bonuses explicit and testable.
- APIs:
  - /score (mock + prod), /eligibility, /attest, /campaign/:id/leaderboard (paginated).
  - ECDSA signer integrates with score store; issues EIP-712 typed allowances.

Acceptance checks
- Replayable scoring across environments with the same dataset.
- Recompute pipeline; diff must be zero for same version on canonical dataset.

### E) Backend Services (Claims + Ops)

Targets
- ECDSA claim signer:
  - EIP-712 domain: name, version, chainId, contract address.
  - Types: Claim { campaignId, claimant, payout, scoreBucket, nonce, expiry }.
  - Nonce book + replay protection; signer rotation; HSM or KMS integration.
- Merkle snapshot builder (optional):
  - Build tree for campaign at a snapshot; publish root to chain; serve proofs.
- Jobs/Queue:
  - Proof generation tasks; concurrency knobs; dead-letter queue.
- Admin APIs:
  - Create campaign, configure curves, windows, funding status, pause/unpause.
  - Export CSV of claims, totals, unclaimed balances.

Acceptance checks
- End-to-end flows in Playwright: connect -> score -> (ECDSA or ZK) claim -> token receipt.
- Load: 1k concurrent claim attempts; queue/backpressure behaves; no data loss.

### F) Client dApp (SvelteKit)

Targets
- Wallet connect (Web3-Onboard) with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase; chain gating.
- Campaign UI:
  - Score preview (mock + prod), payout range, curve explainer.
  - Claim flow picker: ECDSA vs ZK; progress + error states; fee estimation.
- Debug mode:
  - Show env, connected chain, current campaign config, VK hashes, last 10 events.
- Accessibility + i18n-ready skeleton; responsive layouts.

Acceptance checks
- Mock mode behaves exactly per .env defaults; prod toggles via VITE_API_BASE.
- E2E: multiple wallets (local or injected profiles), link to faucet/test tokens.

### G) Infra/DevOps/Observability

Targets
- CI:
  - npm ci → build → lint → unit + contract tests → gas snapshots → e2e (testnet optional).
- CD:
  - Preview env on PR; main -> staging + manual promote to prod; contract deploy job gated by multisig approval.
- Monitoring:
  - Metrics: proofs created/failed, prove p50/p95, claim attempts/success, on-chain events processed.
  - Logs structured; correlation IDs across request→proof→claim.
- Secrets:
  - Sealed secrets / SSM; no secrets in .env committed; signer key in KMS/HSM.

Acceptance checks
- “Red button” rollback: revert to previous dApp build; pause campaigns on-chain; rotate signer.

### H) Security, Audit, and Bounty

Targets
- Static + dynamic analysis:
  - Slither, MythX (optional), Foundry fuzz, Echidna properties.
- Threat model:
  - Replay, oracle poisoning (data inputs), model inversion attacks, frontrunning, re-entrancy, precision/rounding exploits.
- Audit:
  - Independent review of contracts + critical off-chain services.
- Bounty: scope and rewards; safe harbor policy; disclosure channel.

Acceptance checks
- All high/critical issues fixed; proofs of fix included; attestations documented.

### I) Tokenomics and Curves

Formalization
- Normalize score s into s' ∈ [0,1]:
  $
  s' = \min\left(1, \max\left(0, \frac{s - s_\text{floor}}{s_\text{cap} - s_\text{floor}}\right)\right)
  $
- Payout with SQRT curve:
  $
  p(s) = \left\lfloor p_{\min} + (p_{\max} - p_{\min}) \cdot \sqrt{s'} \right\rfloor
  $
- Alternatives:
  - Linear, Log, Piecewise; ensure monotonicity and capped variance.

On-chain invariants
- Given s' bounds proven or attested, contract computes p(s) deterministically.
- Rounding stays in claimant’s favor by <= 1 unit; document explicitly.

---

## 5) Benchmarks and Budgets

Gas (targets; verify with Foundry/Hardhat)
- ECDSA claim: ≤ 120k–160k gas depending on events.
- ZK claim (verify): ≤ 350k–550k gas depending on verifier curve/lib.
- Funding + admin: amortized negligible vs. distribution.

Latency
- Prover p50 ≤ 10s (CPU), p95 ≤ 25s; GPU path p50 ≤ 3s.
- End-to-end claim UX ≤ 30s including wallet prompts.

Throughput
- Queue: 10 proofs/min sustained; burst 100/min with autoscale.

---

## 6) Test Strategy

Unit
- Contracts: payout monotonicity, edge scores (floor, cap, zero), window/nonce, ERC20 funding/allowance.
- Client: stores, hooks, parsers; env handling (mock vs prod).
- Backend: signer correctness; TTL/expiry; replay; rate limits; versioning.

Property/Fuzz
- Score → payout properties; no decreasing segments; rounding bounds.
- Claim sequences under concurrency; no double-spend.

Integration
- Prove/verify loops; ABI stability across VK rotation; signer rotation; pause/unpause.
- Web-of-trust proof-of-membership.

E2E (Playwright)
- Wallet connect flows; claim with insufficient score; expired signatures; wrong chain; paused campaign.
- Mobile viewport runs.

Perf/Load
- Prover soak; queue backpressure; RPC 429 resilience.

---

## 7) Observability and Runbooks

Metrics (export + dashboard)
- proofs.created, proofs.failed, prove.latency.{p50,p95,max}
- claims.requested, claims.success, claims.fail.{reason}
- onchain.events.Claim, funds.remaining, signer.rotations
- rpc.errors, rate.limit.hits

Runbooks
- Rotate signer key: pause → rotate → test → unpause.
- Rotate VK/modelVersion: close current campaign or deploy new verifier mapping; announce.
- RPC provider outage: failover list; jittered retries; backoff.
- Incident response: severity matrix, paging, user comms template.

---

## 8) Security Model and Threats

Threats
- Replay/nonce mishandling → double-claims.
- Precision/rounding exploitation at score boundaries.
- Model inversion / membership inference (mitigate via limited disclosure and range proofs).
- Oracle poisoning (garbage features) → cap inputs to audited sources; snapshotting.
- Frontrunning: ensure claims are non-transferable and bound to claimant; include msg.sender checks.

Controls
- EIP-712 with chainId + expiry; nonces; per-campaign domain.
- On-chain curve with bounded inputs; explicit rounding rules.
- Minimal public inputs in proofs; commit to model/version.
- Rate limits; multi-RPC quorum for indexing (if you build indexers).
- Timelocked admin or multisig with thresholds.

---

## 9) Concrete Interfaces and Specs

ECDSA Typed Data (example)
- Domain:
  - name: "ShadowgraphAirdrop"
  - version: "1"
  - chainId: PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID
  - verifyingContract: VITE_AIRDROP_ECDSA_ADDR
- Types:
  - Claim { bytes32 campaignId; address claimant; uint256 payout; uint64 scoreBucket; uint64 nonce; uint64 expiry }
- Hash rules:
  - campaignId = keccak256(campaign config)
  - scoreBucket = floor(score / BUCKET_SIZE) to reduce leakage

ZK Proof Public Inputs (example)
- addressCommit = hash(address || salt)
- campaignId
- floor, cap, curveId, modelVersionCommit
- Output predicate: score ∈ [floor, cap]; salt not revealed.

Curve IDs
- 0: Linear, 1: SQRT, 2: LOG, 3: Piecewise; map to on-chain computation paths.

## 11) Risks, Trade-offs, and Mitigations

- Proof latency vs UX: Pre-prove during “Check eligibility” step; cache proofs; keep on-chain verification fast.
- Model drift vs stability: Version lock per campaign; rotate only between campaigns; publish hashes.
- Gas spikes: Prefer L2s (Base/OP); cap per-claim gas; pause if costs exceed budget.
- RPC limits: Multi-provider client with failover; cache reads; exponential backoff.
- Sybil risk: Web-of-trust helps, but attackers adapt. Iterate scoring; penalize clustered behavior; constantly measure.

---

## 12) How to Run and Validate Locally

Environment
- Create .env with provided defaults (mock mode); see .github/copilot-instructions.md.

Commands (macOS zsh)
```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
npm run test:unit
# Optional e2e (requires Playwright browsers)
npx playwright install
npm run test:e2e
```

Manual validation
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Verify “Claim Your Reputation-Based Airdrop” heading; nav links; Connect Wallet button; footer “Powered by Shadowgraph”.
- Run claim in mock mode (both ECDSA and ZK placeholders).
- Switch to prod mode by setting VITE_API_BASE and real contract addresses.

---

## 13) Open Questions (Decide Fast)

- Do we include payout-in-circuit or keep payout-on-chain with range proofs? (Recommend range proofs.)
- Single VK per campaign or per modelVersion across campaigns? (Recommend per modelVersion across campaigns to amortize audits.)
- Adopt Foundry alongside Hardhat for fuzzing/gas? (Recommend yes.)
- Which L2 for first mainnet launch? (Recommend Base for ecosystem + tooling; OP as backup.)
- Do we ship Merkle snapshot path now or later? (Optional; do it if we expect >50k claims in a short window.)

---

## 14) Definition of Done (Mainnet-Ready)

- Contracts deployed, verified, and admin-controlled by multisig; addresses published.
- CI/CD green; reproducible builds; artifacts published (ABIs, VKs, model hashes).
- ECDSA and ZK claim paths both live; docs updated; dashboards operational.
- Audit signed off; bounty active; incident runbooks rehearsed.
- First public campaign executed with measurable KPIs and postmortem.
