```typescript
export type MockWalletState = {
  enabled: boolean;
  connectionState: "disconnected" | "connecting" | "connected" | "error" | "switching";
  walletType: "metamask" | "walletconnect" | "coinbase" | "trust" | null;
  address: `0x${string}` | null;
  chainId: number;
  error: string | null;
  userReputationTier: "high" | "medium" | "threshold" | "ineligible";
  networkSupported: boolean;
  simulateSlowConnection: boolean;

#### **3. Enhanced Wallet Button (`WalletButton.svelte`)**

```typescript
// State-aware wallet button with mock integration
$: isConnecting =
  connecting || ($walletMock.enabled && $walletMock.connectionState === "connecting");
$: isConnected =
  $wallet.connected || ($walletMock.enabled && $walletMock.connectionState === "connected");
