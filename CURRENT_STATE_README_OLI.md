# Task Completed: Current State Summary

## Main Task: Run E2E Demo Including Frontend

The primary goal is to execute a full end-to-end demonstration of the Reputation-gated-airdrop project, covering:

- **Backend**: ZK proofs, EBSL scores, contract verification, airdrop claiming via CLI script.
- **Frontend**: Svelte app interactions like wallet connection, ZK proof generation in `ZKMLProver.svelte`, claiming in `claim/+page.svelte`.

### Success Criteria

- **Backend Flow**: Successful score computation, mock proof verification, and eligibility check.
- **Frontend Rendering/Functionality**: Validation via dev server and Playwright E2E tests.
- **Integration**: No errors during the overall workflow.

### Outputs

- `demo-results.json`
- Logs
- Test reports

The workflow is orchestrated step-by-step, with the backend CLI demo separate from frontend UI tests.

## Subtask Progress: Environment Setup (In Progress)

### Completed

- Reviewed `E2E_DEMO_GUIDE.md` and `run-full-e2e-demo.sh`.
- Confirmed CLI-based backend flow:
  - **Prerequisites**: Node.js v18+, `yarn install`, Hardhat node.
  - **Steps**: Start node, deploy contracts, run TypeScript script for EBSL/ZK simulation.
  - **Note**: Frontend is not integrated in the scriptâ€”requires separate `yarn dev` and `tests/e2e/` specs like `zkml-frontend.spec.ts`.

### In Progress (Blocked)

- **Dependency Installation and Environment Verification**:
  - Previous attempts failed due to disk space exhaustion (`ENOSPC` during `yarn install`; root at 100% usage).
  - Current state:
    - `yarn.lock` present but no `node_modules/package-lock.json`, indicating dependencies are not installed.
    - `deployed-addresses.json` exists (no redeploy needed).
    - Key files confirmed: `mock-data.json`, ABIs in `src/lib/abi/`.
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Check disk space (`df -h /`) and free space if low.
    - Retry `yarn install`, `yarn test`, and `yarn playwright test`.

## Pending Subtasks

1. **Execute Backend Demo**:
   - Run `./scripts/demo/run-full-e2e-demo.sh` (starts Hardhat, deploys, simulates flow).
   - Verify outputs like `demo-results.json`.

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Start Vite server: `yarn dev` (localhost:5173).
   - Run E2E tests (`wallet-connection.spec.ts`, `zkml-frontend.spec.ts`) to confirm UI flows:
     - Connect wallet.
     - Generate proof.
     - Claim.

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Review logs, JSON outputs, and test reports for:
     - Pass/fail results.
     - Timings.
     - Errors (e.g., proof rejection, transaction reverts).

4. **Synthesize Findings**:
   - Compile an overview of demo success, gaps (e.g., mock vs. real ZK), and improvements (e.g., integrate frontend into demo script, add real EZKL proofs).

## Overall Status

- **Setup**: Blocked on disk space/dependencies.
- **Backend**: Ready once dependencies are installed.
- **Frontend Tests**: Pending dev server setup.

### Estimated Time Post-Setup

- **Backend**: 5-10 minutes.
- **Frontend Tests**: 10-15 minutes.

### Risks

- Port conflicts (8545/8546).
- Invalid mock data.
- Test failures from unmocked dependencies.

### Next Action

Resolve setup issues in code mode.
